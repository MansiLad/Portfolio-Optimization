# Portfolio Optimization
 # Description: This program attempts to optimize a users portfolio using the Efficient Frontier & Python.
A program to optimize a stock portfolio using the efficient frontier & Python ! In modern portfolio theory, the efficient frontier is an investment portfolio which occupies the ‘efficient’ parts of the risk-return spectrum. Formally, it is the set of portfolios which satisfy the condition that no other portfolio exists with a higher expected return but with the same standard deviation of return.
The Sharpe Ratio goes further: it actually helps you find the best possible proportion of these stocks to use, in a portfolio.

The Sharpe ratio was developed by William F. Sharpe in 1966. The ratio describes how much excess return you receive for the extra volatility you endure for holding a riskier asset. It measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset (bonds, treasury bills, etc.), after adjusting for its risk. It is defined as the difference between the returns of the investment and the risk-free return, divided by the standard deviation of the investment.

So what is considered a good Sharpe ratio that indicates a high degree of expected return for a relatively low amount of risk?
Usually, any Sharpe ratio greater than 1.0 is considered acceptable to good by investors. A ratio higher than 2.0 is rated as very good. A ratio of 3.0 or higher is considered excellent. A ratio under 1.0 is considered sub-optimal.
